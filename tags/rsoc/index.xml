      <description>Greetings! I&amp;rsquo;m Emad Sohail (aka PremadeS), a 2nd-year Computer Science student at Information Technology University - Lahore. I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about contributing to open source projects mainly geared toward cybersecurity. You can find me on Github and LinkedIn.
In this project I introduced a new Mark API to support address-range annotations (marks) in Rizin, particularly for visual feedback in hexdump views. It can be thought of as an enhancement to the existing flag system.</description>
