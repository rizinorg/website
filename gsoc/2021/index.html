You can read more on the Radare2 - GSoC 2020 page. This year we participate as a fork - Rizin, but effectively continuing the same process and the same mentors.\nMentors Members of the Rizin and Cutter core teams have volunteered to guide students for GSoC’21. They were already guiding the students for the GSoC and RSoC in past years as part of the Radare2 project. Please feel free to reach out to any of them in case you need any help in selecting a project.\n Anton Kochkov Mattermost: xvilka – @akochkov Riccardo Shirone Mattermost: ret2libc Florian Märkl Mattermost/Telegram: @thestr4ng3r – @thestr4ng3r Antide Petit IRC/Telegram: xarkes – @xarkes_ Itay Cohen Mattermost/Telegram: @Megabeets @Megabeets_ Giovanni Dante Grazioli Mattermost/Telegram: @deroad @der0ad Yossi Zapesochini Mattermost/Telegram: @yossizap And many others  Development methodology Currently, all repositories are hosted on GitHub main organization account, bugs are tracked on GitHub issues too. We are mostly using our own Mattermost instance, IRC, and Telegram) for communication. We have a testsuite (that is running on GitHub Actions, Travis CI, AppVeyor and SourceHut) to test and verify that all the features are still working and that a pull requests or commits don’t break anything, to ensure the support of different operating systems (Linux, MacOS, Windows, FreeBSD, OpenBSD), different architectures (x86/x86_64, ARM64, PowerPC, SystemZ), and to find regressions. We encourage contributors to write test cases and documentation in order to verify the implementation and ensure that everything fits well together. For complex bugs and examples we’re using ASCIInema for recording the sessions.\nSee also our guides for corresponding projects:\n Rizin Contributing Guide and Developers Intro Cutter Contributing Guide and Developers Intro  For those who want to get introduced to the Rizin codebase and practices, we recommend to pick one of the easy issues for Rizin or Cutter to start with.\nLicense Rizin is modular: this means that it aims to make all the elements and features easily reusable from other projects. The choice of LGPL3 as a license is the minimum requirement to get code merged in Rizin. Contributors can choose Apache, BSD, MIT, Public Domain, or other similar licenses. The reason to exclude GPL as a valid license for the project is because we aim to support proprietary software that uses Rizin, while protecting our free codebase.\nInstructions for students It is a requirement that students who want to apply to the Rizin project for the Google Summer of Code 2021 should submit a small pull request accomplishing one of the microtasks (see below) as part of their application. Though you can also choose any of the GitHub issues for Rizin if they are big enough to be a qualification task, and still small enough to be finished no more than in a couple of weeks.\nProgramming languages Most of Rizin is written in C (conforming C99 standard) and hence we expect students to be familiar with C programming language. For some of our tasks or microtasks, such as collaborative RE or rz-pm, students should know the Go programming language. For the Cutter tasks, students should know C++ and Qt framework basics.\nRecommended steps  Read Google’s instructions for participating Grab any of the project from list of ideas that you’re interested in (or propose your own). Write a first draft proposal using Google Docs and our template and ask one of the mentors or administrators to review it with you. Submit it using Google’s web interface.  Student proposal guidelines  Keep it simple enough to fit in no more than a couple of pages. Try to be clear and concise in your writing. Try to split GSoC period into tasks, and each task into subtasks. It helps us to understand how you plan to accomplish your goals, but more importantly, it’ll help you to understand the task deep enough before starting, and prioritize important things to do first. Please, note, how much time a day/week you are able to spend on this project. Specify your timezone, since so we can assign you a mentor in the same one, to ease communication. Submit your proposal early, not in the last minute! Be sure to choose a “backup” idea (the second task you want to do), so that conflicts (two students for one task) can be resolved.  Project Ideas Rizin Type Analysis Improvements Currently we have types support in Rizin, including basic (low-level) ability to edit type with pf and higher-level, C-like types with t command. It is possible to parse the C type definition from C headers for example, or load from “precompiled” SDB file. However, despite such features being present, many of them still lack the right structures and connections between them to make complex automated and manual analysis of code using types convenient. The goal of this task is to build upon the currently available features and re-think or re-design some of them to fit into the bigger picture of the entire framework. The overall plan for this project is tracked at https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/projects/3. There are certain dependencies between some of the subtasks, but as long as these are respected, subtasks to be taken for GSoC can be picked by preference.\nTask (proposal)  Bundle all types functionality in a new module RzTypes #369 Refactor some base type accesses to use the RzAnalysisBaseType API #368 Replace the current TCC-based C types parser by a Tree-sitter based one #275  Skills Student should know C as well as be familiar with basics of the program analysis. They should also be passionate about software architecture.\nDifficulty Hard\nBenefits for the student Student will understand modern program analysis problems related to type analysis, as well as gain skills in the field of software architecture of a large, modular C project with complex dependencies between modules.\nAssess requirements for midterm/final evaluation  1st term: RzTypes module exists and contains all relevant code. Final term: Tree-sitter based C parser is implemented and integrated into the analysis framework.  Mentors  xvilka thestr4ng3r  Links/Resources  Type Analysis Improvements Project C++ grammar for tree-sitter  CPU/Platform profiles While instruction set defines architecture, it is common that particular CPU or SoC models implement only a subset of it or extend it with custom instructions and registers. Moreover, various SoC modifications can define peripheral devices interaction through ports (rare), registers or MMIO spaces. All this helps the reverse engineering process, because a lot of the code will make sense upon a glance once you see it accesses certain registers (if named) or peripheral devices (when MMIO area is defined). A common example is SVD loading for ARM architecture.\nTask  Implement support for CPU profiles Implement support for platform profiles Add support for register and MMIO specific setups Integrate these in analysis loop, handling register and memory accesses. Implement tests and documentation in Rizin book Provide an API for setting these values from rz-pipe and lang-* plugins  Skills Student should know C and understand basics of the hardware platforms, architectures and chips.\nDifficulty Medium\nBenefits for the student The student will improve familiarity with reverse engineering for various architectures and platforms, along with the improving the efficiency of Rizin.\nBenefits for the project Huge benefits for end users in UX and better support for extension.\nAssess requirements for evaluations  1st term: CPU and platform profiles, some most common profiles, integration with the analysis loop Final term: Support for more platforms, regression and unit tests, documentation (including Rizin book).  Mentors  xvilka deroad  Links/Resources  Issue #103 SVD loader for Ghidra How to use SVD loader with Ghidra SVD parser in Rust CMSIS-SVD repository  Rz-diff improvements Rizin has had the ability to perform binary diffing for over a decade. Nevertheless the support is quite basic and there is room for improvement. One of the most important tasks is to deepen the integration with analysis loop. Integration with the analysis loop will allow Rizin to find and highlight the difference between arguments count, local variables count, their types and other analysis metainformation. The next big task is to modernize rz-diff (and corresponding parts in RCore) in terms of performance and user interface. And of course - cover the rz-diff and rizin diffing features with regression tests and unit tests.\nTasks  Support diffing of the different parts of the same buffer/file Split view for hexadecimal view and disassembly diffing mode Improve the integration with analysis (variables and types differences) Integrate ESIL and decompilation (rz-ghidra, jsdec) pseudocode as an options for binary diffing Implement the most important diffing strategies from Diaphora Write the test cases for Rizin regression tests and improve the results.  Skills Student should know C as well as be familiar with basics of the program analysis. Having an experience with other binary diffing software is a plus.\nDifficulty Medium\nBenefits for the student Student will understand modern program analysis problems in application to binary diffing, and how to improve the performance of patch analysis.\nBenefits for the project This feature will make Rizin usable for day-to-day patch analysis of modern software, as well as improve the automation and performance of this task.\nAssess requirements for midterm/final evaluation  1st term: rz-diff/rizin should support highlighting types, arguments, and variables differences between functions. Fina term: Implement split-view for hex, disassembly, and graph modes. Their interface and performance improvements. Write the regression tests for all implemented features, add the documentation in Rizin book.

(Un)fortunately, building ROP chain by hand can be tedious, this is why some tools can be used to ease this construction: ImmunityDBG has mona.py, there is also ROPgadget and dropper.There exist even tools that can generate ROP chains automatically, for example exrop. It’s a shame that despite having ESIL, Rizin doesn’t have something similar yet. One of the possible solutions would be to build an external plugin or tool which will reuse power of librz and rz-gg. Moreover it makes sense to think about SROP, COOP and BROP support.\nThe rz-gg tool while has the ability to create a custom shellcode has the outdated database of the shellcodes, so updating them is crucial for the tool to be relevant.\nTask  Update the shellcodes database, imrove rz-gg features and documentation Implement a ropchain syntax parser that uses rz-gg or a custom DSL, something like:  register reg1 = 0; register reg2 = whatever; register reg3 = reg1 + reg2; system(reg3); Write a compiler which uses SMT solver (like Z3 for example) to produce the ropchain. Support main architectures - x86, ARM, MIPS, PowerPC  Skills The student should be comfortable with the C language, know some assembly and a high-level language. Also, knowing a little bit of automatic binary analysis wouldn’t hurt.\nDifficulty Advanced\nBenefits for the student The student will improve their skills in software exploitation and solvers.\nBenefits for the project This feature would greatly help during exploits development, and people would be able to ditch mona.py for Rizin ;)\nAssess requirements for evaluation  1st term: Creating the language for defining the ROP chain semantics and integrating it with SMT solver Final term: Working ropchain compiler, covered by tests and documented in the Rizin book.

While this reduced interface is beneficial and well-suited for many scripting tasks, building more complex applications generally requires direct access to the public C api that Rizin offers. Using this API is directly possible in C and C++, as it is done in Cutter for example, but for other languages no generic bindings exist so far. The goal of this task is to use a bindings generator such as SWIG to expose Rizin’s C API to languages such as Python, Java or OCaml.\nTask  Integrate SWIG-generated bindings into Rizin’s build system Write SWIG interfaces for all mature parts of Rizin’s C API Integrate the Python bindings into Cutter’s Python support  Skills The student should be comfortable with the C and Python languages, as well as have a deep understanding of common memory management patterns such as ownership and reference counting.\nDifficulty Advanced\nBenefits for the student The student will gain an experience of exposing a C-based API with manual memory management to high-level, object-oriented languages with automatic memory management.\nAssess requirements for midterm/final evaluation  1st term: Bindings can be generated as part of the standard Rizin build system and small parts of the core API are already usable. Final term: All relevant parts of the API can be used through bindings and also from within Cutter’s Python interpreter.

We need to improve a lot of things about our Plugins support and take it few steps ahead. This task is only about improving the Python interface in Cutter, specifically its graphical user interface components. For a task about exposing Rizin’s API for disassembly, analysis and other purposes, see the Rizin bindings task above.\nTask  Expose everything Cutter can offer for plugins authors. This includes high level API, integration of the plugin management etc. Accessing everything from Python (like Blender) - see issue #1662 Python integration and IPython console.  Skills The student should be comfortable with the C++ and Python languages, and be familiar with Qt framework\nDifficulty Advanced\nBenefits for the student The student will gain an experience of creating a suitable API for scripting graphical interface programs.\nBenefits for the project It will greatly improve the scripting experience, will make API more consistent and will ease creating Cutter plugins by the community. Moreover, it will simplify testing of the Cutter features.\nAssess requirements for midterm/final evaluation  1st term: Design of the high level API and required Rizin changes. Review and implement all missing API functions that are accessible as interface controls. Final term: Implement the way to show the API when hovered over some interface control, create documentation.  Mentors  thestr4ng3r Megabeets  Links/Resources  SDB Module/API for Cutter Python/Jupyter integration Jupyter plugin for Cutter  Multi-Tasking and Event-driven architecture Cutter is a reverse engineering framework that is powered by Rizin. The information it gets about functions, strings, imports, and the analysis are all performed in Rizin and displayed in Cutter. Currently, Cutter is pulling information from Rizin only on demand. This is problematic because sometimes the user performs changes (via plugins, the console widget, and more) that are affecting the information from Rizin, but Cutter doesn’t know about these changes to apply the to the UI. For example, if a user will define a new function in a Python script or via the console widget by using the Rizin command af @ , Cutter will now show this new function in the Functions widget until the user will refresh the interface manually (edit - Refresh Contents).\nIn addition, this task will also handle the analysis in the background feature, to allow the analysis performed by Rizin to happen while the interface is active.\nTasks The overall implementation of this task should start from Rizin by adding events to many of the functions. This can be done using rz_events. For example, add an even for function creating, for section creation, for flag deletion, for name changed, and more\n Add events to all the relevant functions inside Rizin Add support for these events in Cutter and refresh and update the relevant widgets per each event Support analysis in the background and allow the user to start its session while Rizin is analyzing (see #1856, #1574)  Skills The student should be comfortable with the C++ for Cutter and C for Rizin. The student should be familiar with Qt framework.\nDifficulty Advanced\nBenefits for the student The student will gain an experience of creating complex event-driven software in both C and C++ languages.\nBenefits for the project It will allow to work on big files effortlessly in Cutter, will improve analysis quality as well.\nAssess requirements for midterm/final evaluation  1st term: Implement events everywhere in the relevant places across Rizin code and event-driven interaction with Cutter. Final term: Add support for the Cutter interface refresh based on the events from Rizin, implement analysis in background.  Mentors  thestr4ng3r Karliss  Heap viewer We already have a nice heap (and memory map) parser and visualizer in Rizin (dm and dmh commands). After debugging becomes a first-class citizen in cutterland it would be awesome to have memory map and heap visualizations.\nTask  Expose Rizin API/commands for Cutter to use for visualization Design and implement heap navigation and inspection widgets Provide the integration with current debugging mode in Cutter Make the implementation work with both local (native) and remote debugging modes  Skills The student should be comfortable with the C++, and be familiar with Qt framework\nDifficulty Medium\nBenefits for the student The student will gain the understanding on how modern runtimes provide the heap for various programs, which will be beneficial for the binary exploitation skills.\nBenefits for the project It will greatly improve the debugging and reverse engineering experience for complex programs, also provides the way to design the exploitation techniques with the help of Rizin/Cutter.\nAssess requirements for midterm/final evaluation  1st term: Design and implement heap visualization widgets, add Rizin test and fixes Final term: Various bugfixes related to the heap inspection support on various platforms and allocators, tests and documentation.  Mentors  xvilka Megabeets  Links/Resources  Issue #1041 Heap Viewer plugin for IDA Pro Heap parsing for MacOS, tmalloc, jmalloc Dynamic Allocator Detection “heap”-marked Rizin issues  Diffing mode Binary diffing is one of the most common tasks for the reverse engineer. There are many various tools available, but most of them are either detached from the main RE toolbox or poorly integrated. Rizin provides basic diffing features out of the box with rz-diff tool, but Cutter has no interface to represent similar functionality.\nTask  Expose basic rz-diff features in the Cutter Create the interface to choose two files for diffing Create the way to show the differences in all main widgets:  Hexadecimal view Disassembly view Graph view Pseudocode view    Skills The student should be comfortable with the C++ language, and be familiar with Qt framework\nDifficulty Advanced\nBenefits for the student The student will gain an experience of creating efficient graphical interfaces.\nBenefits for the project It will greatly benefit the project since Cutter will be the only FOSS RE tool to provide this feature out of the box.\nAssess requirements for midterm/final evaluation  1st term: Expose the rz-diff features in the Cutter core and create the interface for opening files for diffing. Implement the diff modes for hexadecimal and disassembly views. Final term: Implement the diff modes for graph and pseudocode views, create the documentation.  Mentors  xvilka Megabeets  Links/Resources  Issue #1104 BinDiff Diaphora  Microtasks When taking any of microtasks please be sure someone isn’t already working on them, and let us know if you are going to work on a particular one.\nFile formats Implementing the support for any new file format counts as a microtask. See New File-Format label for pending issues.\nDisassemblers and assemblers Implementing the support for any new architectire counts as a microtask. See New-Architecture label for pending issues.\nELF binary parsing. Rizin parses a lot of information about the ELF but doesn’t print everything. Thus, the improving the output of i* commands and rz-bin tool is important to match up with readelf:\n Add file section type and more flags for sections information (iS\tcommand) Add file offset and memory alignment for segments information (iSS command) Preserve valid names for symbols and sections  Moreover, some information about PLT stubs not being resolved correctly.\nAnalysis The current code analysis has many caveats and issues which need addressing. Fixing them and writing more tests is important to stabilize and enhance rizin’s analysis engine.\nSee these issues or the “Analysis” project on our GitHub dashboard.\nBasefind #413 There are plenty of external scripts and plugins for finding the most probable base for raw firmware images. Opening raw firmwares with rizin is a common use case, so it makes sense to implement it as a part of rizin core.\nHeap analysis #157 Currently Rizin has support for heap exploration and analysis, but the feature is still basic and can be improved. Additionally, other allocators can be added (MacOS, tmalloc, etc.), but this should be done after a proper refactoring, because heap analysis shouldn’t depend on the debugger backend, and we may be able to use different heap tools.\nClass analysis for C++/ObjectiveC/Swift/Dlang/Java #416 Analysis classes, accessible under the ac command, is a relatively new feature of rizin. They provide a way to both manually and automatically manage and use information about classes in the binary.\nDevirtualize method calls using class vtables #414 Consider the following call: call dword [eax + 0x6c] Let’s assume eax is the base pointer of a vtable we have saved in class analysis and we want to find out the actual address of the called method.\nSo there should be a command that takes the offset (in this case 0x6c) and looks up the actual destination. It should be possible to call this command with a specific class, so it only looks into its vtable, or without a class, so it gives a list of possible destinations for all vtables that are not too small for the offset.\nWhen that is implemented, one could also add a command that does the same thing, but automatically takes the offset from the opcode at the current seek.\nAdd classes list to Vb Vb already supports browsing bin classes. The same thing should be implemented for classes from analysis.\nSignatures Rizin has a good support for loading and creating signatures, but it is not yet complete, thus some problems remain, for example: #272.\nAs Rizin supports FLIRT signatures loading from IDA Pro, not all of them are supported yet - e.g. version 5 compression.\nRefactoring Use “newshell” instead of old switch/case handling Rizin is in the middle of the switch from the old style switch/case manual parsing of every command to the centralized Tree-Sitter-based parser, providing every command handler argc/argv arguments. Best candidates for the initial switch are:\n librz/core/cmd_egg.c librz/core/cmd_hash.c  A good example of transition is in these pull requests for t (types) command conversion:\n Migrating Types to the Newshell (1) Migrating Types to the Newshell (2) Migrating Types to the Newshell (3) Adding autocompletion for types commands  Use internal API instead of commands Currently, Rizin’s source code is rife with calls to rz_core_cmd()-like functions that run the Rizin command. While it is a useful shortcut for developer, it makes a good source of the potential bugs in case of the command syntax or behavior change. If these changes happen they are invisible to the compiler, so it cannot warn on the changed syntax. It isn’t the case of changed function arguments count or type. Thus, all these calls eventually should be substituted with direct calls to the corresponding API functions. If there is no corresponding API funciton, then one should be created. Good examples of such cases are:\n Refactor Graph processing from commands to the API use Refactor Visual mode from commands to the API use Refactor Panels mode from commands to the API use  In general you can just search for rz_core_cmd pattern in any place inside librz/.\nImproving the uplifting of the code to IL Rizin has its own intermediate language - ESIL, but not yet support it for all architectures. So the task is to add ESIL support to any architecture, which doesn’t has it yet.\nMiscellanous Shell (dietline) improvements Currently Rizin uses its own readline-compatible implementation of the input handling in the embedded shell that is compact and portable between all supported platforms. It supports both Emacs and Vi modes, but not all bindings and features are supported. Some are omitted by choice, but some were simply not implemented. See the “dietline”-labeled issues.\nImproving regression suite and testing It is required to solve numerous issues, along with improving parallel execution and performance. Good example is to allow better filtering of the test types to run, for example to ignore debug tests. The next interesting idea is to setup and reuse Godbolt compilation engine for generating tests for different compilers and compilation options. There is even a command line tool for interacting with Godbolt - cce.\nAnother important part of the improving test suite is to cover more different formats and cases with expanding it. See the #114 issue with more details on how it can be done.\nRzGhidra There are many small issues in the decompiler output:\n String detection problem and one more. Show function arguments in calls pdgsd commands showing incorrect P-code Prioritize keeping vars with lower addresses Minor improvements for the SLEIGH plugin  Some of these issues might be related on how Rizin and RzGhidra integrate and might require changes in the Rizin side.\nAlso note that most of these issues should be paired with the test to verify it will not break in the future.\n","wordCount":"4257","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Rizin"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://rizin.re/gsoc/2021/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Rizin","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://rizin.re/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add('dark'):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove('dark'):window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches&&document.body.classList.add('dark')</script><noscript><style type=text/css>.theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://rizin.re/ accesskey=h>Rizin</a>

We are mostly using <a href=https://im.rizin.re>our own Mattermost instance</a>, IRC, and <a href=https://t.me/rizinorg>Telegram</a>) for communication.
We have a <a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/tree/dev/test>testsuite</a> (that is running on GitHub Actions, <a href=https://travis-ci.com/rizinorg/rizin>Travis CI</a>, <a href=https://ci.appveyor.com/project/rizinorg/rizin>AppVeyor</a> and SourceHut) to test and verify that all the features are still working and that a pull requests or commits don&rsquo;t break anything, to ensure the support of different operating systems (Linux, MacOS, Windows, FreeBSD, OpenBSD), different architectures (x86/x86_64, ARM64, PowerPC, SystemZ), and to find regressions.
We encourage contributors to write test cases and documentation in order to verify the implementation and ensure that everything fits well together. For complex bugs and examples we&rsquo;re using <a href=http://asciinema.org/>ASCIInema</a> for recording the sessions.</p><p>See also our guides for corresponding projects:</p><ul><li>Rizin <a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md>Contributing Guide</a> and <a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/blob/dev/DEVELOPERS.md>Developers Intro</a></li><li>Cutter <a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/cutter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>Contributing Guide</a> and <a href=https://cutter.re/docs/code.html>Developers Intro</a></li></ul><p>For those who want to get introduced to the Rizin codebase and practices, we recommend to pick one of the easy issues for <a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/labels/good%20first%20issue>Rizin</a> or <a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/cutter/labels/good%20first%20issue>Cutter</a> to start with.</p><h2 id=license>License<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#license>#</a></h2><p>Rizin is modular: this means that it aims to make all the elements and features easily reusable from other projects. The choice of <a href=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html>LGPL3</a> as a license is the minimum requirement to get code merged in Rizin. Contributors can choose Apache, BSD, MIT, Public Domain, or other similar licenses. The reason to exclude GPL as a valid license for the project is because we aim to support proprietary software that uses Rizin, while protecting our free codebase.</p><h2 id=instructions-for-students>Instructions for students<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#instructions-for-students>#</a></h2><p>It is a requirement that students who want to apply to the Rizin project for the Google Summer of Code 2021 should submit a small pull request accomplishing one of the <a href=#microtasks>microtasks</a> (see below) as part of their application. Though you can also choose any of the GitHub issues for Rizin if they are big enough to be a qualification task, and still small enough to be finished no more than in a couple of weeks.</p><h2 id=programming-languages>Programming languages<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#programming-languages>#</a></h2><p>Most of Rizin is written in C (conforming C99 standard) and hence we expect students to be familiar with C programming language. For some of our tasks or microtasks, such as collaborative RE or <a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rz-pm>rz-pm</a>, students should know the Go programming language. For the <a href=#cutter>Cutter tasks</a>, students should know C++ and Qt framework basics.</p><h2 id=recommended-steps>Recommended steps<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#recommended-steps>#</a></h2><ol><li>Read Google&rsquo;s instructions for participating</li><li>Grab any of the project from list of ideas that you&rsquo;re interested in (or propose your own).</li><li>Write a first draft proposal using Google Docs and <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kDPGgr_D5tQuYLQi_gEGlkuQ-DlU8GH5kDBqZbVSC7I/edit?usp=sharing">our template</a> and ask one of the mentors or administrators to review it with you.</li><li>Submit it using Google&rsquo;s web interface.</li></ol><h2 id=student-proposal-guidelines>Student proposal guidelines<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#student-proposal-guidelines>#</a></h2><ol><li>Keep it simple enough to fit in no more than a couple of pages.

C-like types with <code>t</code> command. It is possible to parse the C type definition from C headers for example,
or load from &ldquo;precompiled&rdquo; SDB file.
However, despite such features being present, many of them still lack the right structures and connections between them
to make complex automated and manual analysis of code using types convenient.
The goal of this task is to build upon the currently available features and re-think or re-design some of them
to fit into the bigger picture of the entire framework. The overall plan for this project is tracked at
<a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/projects/3>https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/projects/3</a>.
There are certain dependencies between some of the subtasks, but as long as these are respected,
subtasks to be taken for GSoC can be picked by preference.</p><h3 id=task-proposal>Task (proposal)<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#task-proposal>#</a></h3><ol><li>Bundle all types functionality in a new module <code>RzTypes</code> <a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/issues/369>#369</a></li><li>Refactor some base type accesses to use the RzAnalysisBaseType API <a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/issues/368>#368</a></li><li>Replace the current TCC-based C types parser by a Tree-sitter based one <a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/issues/275>#275</a></li></ol><h3 id=skills>Skills<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#skills>#</a></h3><p>Student should know C as well as be familiar with basics of the program analysis.

Moreover, various SoC modifications can define peripheral devices interaction through ports (rare), registers or MMIO spaces. All this helps the reverse engineering process, because a lot of the code will make sense upon a glance once you see it accesses certain registers (if named) or peripheral devices (when MMIO area is defined).

Nevertheless the support is quite basic and there is room for improvement. One of the most important tasks is to deepen the integration with analysis loop. Integration with the analysis loop will allow Rizin to find and highlight the difference between arguments count, local variables count, their types and other analysis metainformation. The next big task is to modernize rz-diff (and corresponding parts in RCore) in terms of performance and user interface. And of course - cover the rz-diff and rizin diffing features with regression tests and unit tests.</p><h3 id=tasks>Tasks<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tasks>#</a></h3><ul><li>Support diffing of the different parts of the same buffer/file</li><li>Split view for <a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/issues/126>hexadecimal view</a> and disassembly diffing mode</li><li>Improve the integration with analysis (variables and types differences)</li><li>Integrate ESIL and decompilation (<a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rz-ghidra>rz-ghidra</a>, <a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/jsdec>jsdec</a>) pseudocode as an options for binary diffing</li><li>Implement the most important diffing strategies from Diaphora</li><li>Write the test cases for Rizin regression tests and improve the results.</li></ul><h3 id=skills-2>Skills<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#skills-2>#</a></h3><p>Student should know C as well as be familiar with basics of the program analysis.

to the centralized <a href=https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter/>Tree-Sitter</a>-based parser, providing every command handler <code>argc</code>/<code>argv</code>
arguments.
Best candidates for the initial switch are:</p><ul><li><code>librz/core/cmd_egg.c</code></li><li><code>librz/core/cmd_hash.c</code></li></ul><p>A good example of transition is in these pull requests for <code>t</code> (types) command conversion:</p><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/pull/700>Migrating Types to the Newshell (1)</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/pull/728>Migrating Types to the Newshell (2)</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/pull/739>Migrating Types to the Newshell (3)</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/pull/785>Adding autocompletion for types commands</a></li></ul><h3 id=use-internal-api-instead-of-commands>Use internal API instead of commands<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#use-internal-api-instead-of-commands>#</a></h3><p>Currently, Rizin&rsquo;s source code is rife with calls to <code>rz_core_cmd()</code>-like functions that run the Rizin command. While it is a useful shortcut for developer, it makes a good source of the potential bugs in case of the command syntax or behavior change. If these changes happen they are invisible to the compiler, so it cannot warn on the changed syntax. It isn&rsquo;t the case of changed function arguments count or type.
Thus, all these calls eventually should be substituted with direct calls to the corresponding API
functions. If there is no corresponding API funciton, then one should be created.
Good examples of such cases are:</p><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/issues/397>Refactor Graph processing from commands to the API use</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/issues/382>Refactor Visual mode from commands to the API use</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/issues/383>Refactor Panels mode from commands to the API use</a></li></ul><p>In general you can just search for <code>rz_core_cmd</code> pattern in any place inside <code>librz/</code>.</p><h3 id=improving-the-uplifting-of-the-code-to-il>Improving the uplifting of the code to IL<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#improving-the-uplifting-of-the-code-to-il>#</a></h3><p>Rizin has its own intermediate language - ESIL, but not yet support it for all architectures. So
the task is to add ESIL support to any architecture, which doesn&rsquo;t has it yet.</p><h2 id=miscellanous>Miscellanous<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#miscellanous>#</a></h2><h3 id=shell-dietline-improvements>Shell (dietline) improvements<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#shell-dietline-improvements>#</a></h3><p>Currently Rizin uses its own readline-compatible implementation of the input handling in the
embedded shell that is compact and portable between all supported platforms. It supports both Emacs
and Vi modes, but not all bindings and features are supported. Some are omitted by choice, but some
were simply not implemented. See the <a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/labels/dietline>&ldquo;dietline&rdquo;-labeled issues</a>.</p><h3 id=improving-regression-suite-and-testing>Improving regression suite and testing<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#improving-regression-suite-and-testing>#</a></h3><p>It is required to solve <a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/labels/rz-test>numerous issues</a>, along with improving parallel execution and performance.
Good example is to allow better filtering of the test types to run, for example to <a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/issues/336>ignore debug tests</a>.
The next interesting idea is to setup and reuse Godbolt compilation engine for generating tests for different compilers and compilation options. There is even a command line tool for interacting with Godbolt - <a href=https://github.com/ethanhs/cce>cce</a>.</p><p>Another important part of the improving test suite is to cover more different formats and cases with
expanding it. See the <a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/issues/114>#114 issue</a> with more details on how it can be done.</p><h2 id=rzghidra>RzGhidra<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#rzghidra>#</a></h2><p>There are many small issues in the decompiler output:</p><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rz-ghidra/issues/85>String detection problem</a> and <a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rz-ghidra/issues/73>one more</a>.</li><li><a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rz-ghidra/issues/74>Show function arguments in calls</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rz-ghidra/issues/172><code>pdgsd</code> commands showing incorrect P-code</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rz-ghidra/issues/167>Prioritize keeping vars with lower addresses</a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rz-ghidra/issues/133>Minor improvements for the SLEIGH plugin</a></li></ul><p>Some of these issues might be related on how Rizin and RzGhidra integrate and might require changes
in the Rizin side.</p><p>Also note that most of these issues should be paired with the test to verify it will not break in
the future.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><div class=share-buttons><a target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="share GSoC 2021 on twitter"
