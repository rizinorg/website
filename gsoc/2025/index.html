Please feel free to reach out to any of them if you need any help in selecting a project.\nAnton Kochkov Mattermost: xvilka – @akochkov Florian Märkl Mattermost/Telegram: @thestr4ng3r – @thestr4ng3r Giovanni Dante Grazioli Mattermost/Telegram: @deroad @der0ad And many others Development methodology Currently, all repositories are hosted on GitHub main organization account and bugs are tracked on GitHub issues too. We are primarily using our own Mattermost instance, IRC, and Telegram) for communication. We have a testsuite (which is running on GitHub Actions, Travis CI, AppVeyor and SourceHut) to test and verify that all the features are still working and that a pull requests or commits don’t break anything, to ensure the support of different operating systems (Linux, MacOS, Windows, FreeBSD, OpenBSD), different architectures (x86/x86_64, ARM64, PowerPC, SystemZ), and to find regressions. We encourage contributors to write test cases and documentation in order to verify the implementation and ensure that everything fits well together. For complex bugs and examples, we’re using ASCIInema to record the sessions.\nSee also our guides for corresponding projects:\nRizin Contributing Guide and Developers Intro Cutter Contributing Guide and Developers Intro For those who want to get introduced to the Rizin codebase and practices, we recommend to pick one of the easy issues for Rizin or Cutter to start with.\nLicense Rizin is modular: this means that it aims to make all the elements and features easily reusable from other projects. The choice of LGPL3 as a license is the minimum requirement to get code merged in Rizin. Contributors can choose Apache, BSD, MIT, Public Domain, or other similar licenses. The reason to exclude GPL as a valid license for the project is because we aim to support proprietary software that uses Rizin while protecting our free codebase.\nInstructions for participants Participants who want to apply to the Rizin project for the Google Summer of Code 2025 are required to submit a small pull request accomplishing one of the microtasks (see below) as part of their application. You can also choose any of the GitHub issues for Rizin if they are big enough to be a qualification task and still small enough to be finished in no more than a couple of weeks. To help participants understand how to contribute to the project, there are issues marked as “good first issue” for both Rizin and Cutter.\nProgramming languages Most of Rizin is written in C (conforming to the C99 standard), and hence, we expect participants to be familiar with C programming language. For some of our tasks or microtasks, such as rz-pm, they should know the Go programming language. For the Cutter tasks, it is a requirement to know C++ and Qt framework basics.\nRecommended steps Read Google’s instructions for participating Grab any of the projects from the list of ideas that you’re interested in (or propose your own). Write a first draft proposal using Google Docs and our template and ask one of the mentors or administrators to review it with you. Submit it using Google’s web interface. Participant proposal guidelines Keep it simple enough to fit in no more than a couple of pages. Try to be clear and concise in your writing. Try to split the entire GSoC period into tasks and each task into subtasks. It helps us understand how you plan to accomplish your goals, but more importantly, it’ll help you understand the task deep enough before starting and prioritize important things to do first. Please note how much time a day/week you can spend on this project. Please specify which category you apply for - medium task or extended deadline one. Specify your timezone so we can assign you a mentor in the same one to ease communication. Submit your proposal early, not at the last minute! Be sure to choose a “backup” idea (the second task you want to do) so that conflicts (two participants for one task) can be resolved. Project Ideas Cutter Improving usability and user experience (175 hour project) The Cutter’s backend provides many features that are not exposed or exposed in Cutter efficiently. The goal of this task would be to figure out the users’ biggest pain points and address them by improving or reworking the interface. Some of the issues are already in our GitHub, while others might be figured during the cross-comparison with other tools.\nTask Add a scrollbar to the disassembly and hexdump widgets Better syntax highlight and theming Managing window/widget overlays Add information about status of the analysis, signature searching, and other operations Address various small UI problems that make user’s life harder than necessary Skills The participant should be comfortable with the C++ and be familiar with Qt framework. Basics of the design/UX would be a plus.\nDifficulty Advanced\nBenefits for the participant The participant will gain an experience of creating comfortable and efficient user interface with C++/Qt.\nBenefits for the project It will make interface and user experience more consistent, on par with Rizin itself, and other tools.\nAssess requirements for midterm/final evaluation 1st term: Add scrollbar to necessary widget, improve theming and syntax highlight Final term: Managing widgets layouts, docking; provide action status information Mentors thestr4ng3r xvilka Megabeets Links/Resources User Experience project for Cutter User Experience project for Rizin Plugins and Python High Level API (175 hour project) Our current public API to be used by plugin authors is somewhat limited. We need to improve a lot of things about our Plugins support and take it few steps ahead. This task is only about improving the public C++ and Python interface of Cutter, specifically its graphical user interface components. For a task about exposing Rizin’s API for disassembly, analysis and other purposes, see the Rizin bindings task above.\nTask Expose everything Cutter can offer for plugin authors. This includes high level API, integration of the plugin management etc. Accessing everything from Python (like Blender) - see issue #1662 Python integration and IPython console. Skills The participant should be comfortable with the C++ and Python languages, and be familiar with Qt framework\nDifficulty Advanced\nBenefits for the participant The participant will gain an experience of creating a suitable API for scripting graphical interface programs.\nBenefits for the project It will greatly improve the scripting experience, will make API more consistent and will ease creating Cutter plugins by the community. Moreover, it will simplify testing of the Cutter features.\nAssess requirements for midterm/final evaluation 1st term: Design of the high level API and required Rizin changes. Review and implement all missing API functions that are accessible as interface controls. Final term: Implement the way to show the API when hovered over some interface control, create documentation. Mentors thestr4ng3r Megabeets Links/Resources SDB Module/API for Cutter Python/Jupyter integration Jupyter plugin for Cutter Multi-Tasking and Event-driven architecture (350 hour project) The information Cutter gets about functions, strings, imports, and the analysis are all performed in Rizin and only displayed in Cutter. Currently, it is pulling most information from Rizin only on demand. This is problematic because sometimes the user performs changes (via plugins, the console widget, and more) that are affecting the information from Rizin, but Cutter doesn’t know about these changes to apply the to the UI. For example, if a user will define a new function in a Python script or via the console widget by using the Rizin command af @ , Cutter will not show this new function in the Functions widget until the user will refresh the interface manually (Edit -\u003e Refresh Contents). The goal of this task is to use an event-driven architecture to overcome this limitation.\nIn addition, this task will also handle the analysis in the background feature, to allow the analysis performed by Rizin to happen while the interface is active.\nTasks The overall implementation of this task should start from Rizin by adding events to many of the functions. This can be done using rz_events. For example, add an even for function creating, for section creation, for flag deletion, for name changed, and more\nAdd events to all the relevant functions inside Rizin Add support for these events in Cutter and refresh and update the relevant widgets per each event Support analysis in the background and allow the user to start its session while Rizin is analyzing (see #1856, #1574) Skills The participant should be comfortable with the C++ for Cutter and C for Rizin. They should also be familiar with Qt framework. Experience in GUI code architecture, for example using functional reactive programming or Elm-like approaches is a plus.\nDifficulty Advanced\nBenefits for the participant The participant will gain an experience of creating complex event-driven software in both C and C++ languages.\nBenefits for the project It will allow to work on big files effortlessly in Cutter, will improve analysis quality as well.\nAssess requirements for midterm/final evaluation 1st term: Implement events everywhere in the relevant places across Rizin code and event-driven interaction with Cutter. Final term: Add support for the Cutter interface refresh based on the events from Rizin, implement analysis in background. Mentors thestr4ng3r Heap viewer completion (175 hour project) Thanks to the work that was done in the previous GSoC, Cutter and Rizin have nice visualizations of the heap and memory maps. We would like to expand on this feature with performance improvements to the heap parsers and support more memory allocators.\nTask Complete Cutter’s implementation of the windows heap widget #2723 Improve the performance of the Windows heap parser Fix Windows heap parsing errors Make the implementation work with remote debugging modes Skills The participant should be comfortable with the C++, and be familiar with Qt framework\nDifficulty Medium\nBenefits for the participant The participant will gain the understanding on how modern runtimes provide the heap for various programs, which will be beneficial for the binary exploitation skills.\nBenefits for the project It will greatly improve the debugging and reverse engineering experience for complex programs, also provides the way to design the exploitation techniques with the help of Rizin/Cutter.\nAssess requirements for midterm/final evaluation 1st term: Design and implement heap visualization widgets, add Rizin test and fixes Final term: Various bugfixes related to the heap inspection support on various platforms and allocators, tests and documentation. Mentors xvilka Megabeets Links/Resources Issue #1041 Heap Viewer plugin for IDA Pro Heap parsing for MacOS, tmalloc, jmalloc Dynamic Allocator Detection “heap”-marked Rizin issues Diffing mode (175 hour project) Binary diffing is one of the most common tasks for the reverse engineer. There are many tools available, but most of them are either detached from the main RE toolbox or poorly integrated. Rizin provides basic diffing features out of the box with rz-diff tool, but Cutter has no interface to represent similar functionality.\nTask Expose basic rz-diff features in the Cutter Create the interface to choose two files for diffing Create the way to show the differences in all main widgets: Hexadecimal view Disassembly view Graph view Pseudocode view Skills The participant should be comfortable with the C++ language, and be familiar with Qt framework\nDifficulty Medium\nBenefits for the participant The participant will gain an experience of creating efficient graphical interfaces.\nBenefits for the project It will greatly benefit the project since Cutter will be the only FOSS RE tool to provide this feature out of the box.\nAssess requirements for midterm/final evaluation 1st term: Expose the rz-diff features in the Cutter core and create the interface for opening files for diffing. Implement the diff modes for hexadecimal and disassembly views. Final term: Implement the diff modes for graph and pseudocode views, create the documentation. Mentors xvilka deroad Links/Resources Issue #1104 BinDiff Diaphora Rizin Classes analysis for C++/ObjectiveC/Swift/Dlang/Java (350 hour project) Analysis classes, accessible under the ac command, is a relatively new feature of rizin. They provide a way to both manually and automatically manage and use information about classes in the binary. But their support is only bare bones, without supporting various analysis integration, as well as display in the disassembly output.\nConsider the following call: call dword [eax + 0x6c] Let’s assume eax is the base pointer of a vtable we have saved in class analysis and we want to find out the actual address of the called method.\nSo there should be a command that takes the offset (in this case 0x6c) and looks up the actual destination. It should be possible to call this command with a specific class, so it only looks into its vtable, or without a class, so it gives a list of possible destinations for all vtables that are not too small for the offset.\nWhen that is implemented, one could also add a command that does the same thing, but automatically takes the offset from the opcode at the current seek.\nTask Connecting classes with their methods Class inheritance - nesting data structs Constructors and destructors autorecognition try/catch/finally recognition and marking arguments recognition ASCII/graphviz graph of class inheritance/structure inheritance Tests with sources for C++, FreePascal, D language, ObjC and Swift, for rizin-testbins Classes list via Vb. It already supports browsing bin classes. The same thing should be implemented for classes from analysis. Skills Good knowledge of the C language Good knowledge of the C++ language (other languages, like ObjC, Swift, D, etc are a plus) Difficulty Hard\nBenefits for the participant Participant will understand how OOP languages work under the hood, and will master technique of detecting various high level (classes, methods) abstractions in the binary code.\nBenefits for the project It will greatly benefit the project to allow efficient reverse engineering of the programs written in C++ and other OOP languages.\nAssess requirements for midterm/final evaluation 1st term: implement classes integration into the analysis, type inference; detect constructors and destructors, try/catch blocks. Final term: Class inheritance recognition, virtual methods detection, building class inheritance graphs, visual mode to inspect classes and methods relationships. Mentors xvilka deroad Links and resources Improve vtable detection for C++, ObjectiveC, Dlang and Swift binaries - issue #416 Devirtualize method calls using class vtables - issue #414 Debugger improvements and portability (175 hour project) Rizin debugger already supports most of the platforms, including native and remote debugging. Nevertheless, for most platforms it’s limited mostly to the x86/x86_64 and ARMv8, often lacking the tests. The task would be to add missing architectures to the native debugger, e.g. MIPS to the Linux Native, ARMv7/ARMv8 to the FreeBSD, System Z debugger for Linux, HPPA debugger for Linux, VAX debugger for NetBSD, and so on. Moreover, some information isn’t available during the debugging mode, e.g. source-level breakpoints or names, it would be necessary to make sure debug commands understand those.\nWith the help of emulators like QEMU and OpenSIMH we could extend our CI to automatically test these debuggers.\nTask Integrated source-level information loaded from DWARF or PDB into debug commands and print p commands Support for missing architectures that are supported by Rizin statically in the Linux native debugger Support for missing architectures that are supported by Rizin statically in the BSD native debugger Cover more platforms supported by the debugger with automated tests, with CI whenever it’s possible Fix the bugs in debuggers, minor refactorings of the code Skills Good knowledge of the C language Some experience in debugging with GDB or LLDB Difficulty Hard\nBenefits for the participant Participant will understand how debugging works on the low level, and will gain experience with variety of different platforms and operating systems.\nBenefits for the project It will allow efficient low-level debugging on various supported platforms, not only the mainstream ones, greatly improving Rizin’s usefulness in reversing some domain-specific software.\nAssess requirements for midterm/final evaluation 1st term: `SystemZ, MIPS, HPPA support in Linux native, remote GDB debuggers Final term: ARM and SPARC support in *BSD debuggers, VAX support in NetBSD Mentors xvilka thestr4ng3r ret2libc Links/Resources Debug-labeled issues RzDebug-labaled issues New Platform support New Architecture support FRIDA integration (175 hour project) FRIDA is the famous dynamic instrumentation toolkit that is immensely popular among mobile device researches. Rizin could be easily integrated with Frida by creating a plugin that will allow to connect to the Frida instance, receive traces, set breakpoints, get information and events from it.\nTask Create the basic plugin that allows attaching, spwaning, launching processes within Frida loco ally Support remote connection Add feature to receive information from the Frida instanced Add breakpoints and run/step/continue feature’s Support calling functions and scripts in the context of the instrumented process Skills Participant should know C as well as have the experience of working with debuggers.\nDifficulty Hard\nBenefits for the participant Participant will understand and learn how to use Frida toolkit, also the internals of the debugging and instrumentation processes.\nBenefits for the project It will allow easy dynamic code instrumentation right from the Rizin or Cutter session, allowing tracing and code inspection.\nAssess requirements for midterm/final evaluation 1st term: Implement core of the FRIDA plugin, allowing local and remote debugging features Final term: Add support for extended features like calling functions or scripts within the context Mentors xvilka thestr4ng3r wargio Links/Resources FRIDA FRIDA (GitHub) r2frida Exploitation capabilities improvements (175 hour project) Since modern architectures are now enforcing W^X, exploiters are using ROP. (Un)fortunately, building ROP chain by hand can be tedious, this is why some tools can be used to ease this construction: ImmunityDBG has mona.py, there is also ROPgadget and dropper.There exist even tools that can generate ROP chains automatically, for example exrop. It’s a shame that despite having RzIL, Rizin doesn’t have something similar yet. One of the possible solutions would be to build an external plugin or tool which will reuse power of librz and rz-gg. Moreover it makes sense to think about SROP, COOP and BROP support.\nThe last year (GSoC'24) one of our participants started implementing this feature, but it wasn’t finished. You could check the rz-solver repository for more details.\nAlso, the rz-gg tool while has the ability to create a custom shellcode but there is still a lot of work required.\nTask Fix rz-gg issues Write a compiler which uses SMT solver (like Z3 for example) to produce the ropchain: #4563. Support main architectures - x86, ARM, MIPS, PowerPC at the very least Skills The participant should be comfortable with the C language, know some assembly and a high-level language. Also, knowing a little bit of automatic binary analysis wouldn’t hurt.\nDifficulty Advanced\nBenefits for the participant The participant will improve their skills in software exploitation and solvers.\nBenefits for the project This feature would greatly help during exploits development, and people would be able to ditch mona.py for Rizin ;)\nAssess requirements for evaluation 1st term: Creating the language for defining the ROP chain semantics and integrating it with SMT solver Final term: Working ropchain compiler, covered by tests and documented in the Rizin book. Mentors xvilka ret2libc Links/Resources ROPGadget Ropper Angrop ROPC exrop roper2 mona.py from corelan Hunting for ROP Gadgets in Style (2012) dropper a BARF-based rop chain generator Materials about the exloitation workshop at Hack.lu 2014 Slides for the exploitation part of workshop at Hack.lu 2015 RzEgg related bugs Binary case reduce tool (175 hours project) Similar to Csmith/Creduce but operating on the binary files, to reduce the size of the test and to avoid sharing proprietary/classified files.\nIt can perform these operations:\ncut bytes shift zero/0xFF/mask bytes remove section Since it requires some knowledge of the file format, existing libraries like LIEF could be used.\nTask Make a tool to reduce the size of ELF using specified operations Extend it to other formats - PE, MachO Create tests for this tool Research the possibility of minimizing some testcases that are already in the Rizin repository. Skills The participant should be comfortable with the C language, as well as the high-level language of a choice (Python or Rust).\nDifficulty Advanced\nBenefits for the participant The participant will improve their understanding in file formats and their mutation.\nBenefits for the project This feature would greatly help in minimizing and anonimizing testcases for the Rizin and any other binary analysis tool.\nAssess requirements for evaluation 1st term: Create the simple tool to reduce the ELF size Final term: Extend it to other formats, improve the “compression” rate, cover with tests. Mentors xvilka deroad Links/Resources https://github.com/rizinorg/ideas/issues/52 Microtasks When taking any of microtasks please be sure someone isn’t already working on them, and let us know if you are going to work on a particular one.\nCutter UX improvements There are many small issues and missing features that when implemented will improve the user experience significantly:\nAllow adding new flags from hexdump Scrollbar inside disasssembly windows Variables and values popup widgets on mouse hover Allow to set RzRun profiles from the GUI during debugging Double-click on the type in Disasm and Graph widgets should switch to the Types windows and show the selected type Set breakpoint inside X-Refs window Unified dialogue to set debug symbols servers See full list at our User Experience project covering all parts of RizinOrg: Rizin, Cutter, RzGhidra, rz-pm.\nFile formats Implementing the support for any new file format counts as a microtask. See New File-Format label for pending issues.\nDisassemblers and assemblers Implementing the support for any new architecture counts as a microtask. See New-Architecture label for pending issues.\nTwo notable examples are updating existing bytecode plugins to support newer versions of the respective languages:\nSupport for the Lua 5.2 language changes Support for the Python 3.11 and 3.12 language changes Analysis The current code analysis has many caveats and issues which need addressing. Fixing them and writing more tests is important to stabilize and enhance rizin’s analysis engine.\nSee these issues on our GitHub dashboard.\nHeap analysis #157 Currently Rizin has support for heap exploration and analysis, but the feature is still basic and can be improved. Additionally, other allocators can be added (MacOS, tmalloc, etc.), but this should be done after a proper refactoring, because heap analysis shouldn’t depend on the debugger backend, and we may be able to use different heap tools.\nRizin legacy code refactoring Miscellaneous rz-ar - code archives unpacking tool https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/issues/4866\nImproving regression suite and testing It is required to solve numerous issues, along with improving parallel execution and performance. The next interesting idea is to setup and reuse Godbolt compilation engine for generating tests for different compilers and compilation options. There is even a command line tool for interacting with Godbolt - cce.\nUnbreaking broken tests Almost one thousand of tests marked as “broken” in our testsuite.

We are primarily using <a href=https://im.rizin.re>our own Mattermost instance</a>, IRC, and <a href=https://t.me/rizinorg>Telegram</a>) for communication.
We have a <a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/tree/dev/test>testsuite</a> (which is running on GitHub Actions, <a href=https://travis-ci.com/rizinorg/rizin>Travis CI</a>, <a href=https://ci.appveyor.com/project/rizinorg/rizin>AppVeyor</a> and SourceHut) to test and verify that all the features are still working and that a pull requests or commits don&rsquo;t break anything, to ensure the support of different operating systems (Linux, MacOS, Windows, FreeBSD, OpenBSD), different architectures (x86/x86_64, ARM64, PowerPC, SystemZ), and to find regressions.
We encourage contributors to write test cases and documentation in order to verify the implementation and ensure that everything fits well together. For complex bugs and examples, we&rsquo;re using <a href=http://asciinema.org/>ASCIInema</a> to record the sessions.</p><p>See also our guides for corresponding projects:</p><ul><li>Rizin <a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md>Contributing Guide</a> and <a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/blob/dev/DEVELOPERS.md>Developers Intro</a></li><li>Cutter <a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/cutter/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>Contributing Guide</a> and <a href=https://cutter.re/docs/code.html>Developers Intro</a></li></ul><p>For those who want to get introduced to the Rizin codebase and practices, we recommend to pick one of the easy issues for <a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/labels/good%20first%20issue>Rizin</a> or <a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/cutter/labels/good%20first%20issue>Cutter</a> to start with.</p><h2 id=license>License<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#license>#</a></h2><p>Rizin is modular: this means that it aims to make all the elements and features easily reusable from other projects. The choice of <a href=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html>LGPL3</a> as a license is the minimum requirement to get code merged in Rizin. Contributors can choose Apache, BSD, MIT, Public Domain, or other similar licenses. The reason to exclude GPL as a valid license for the project is because we aim to support proprietary software that uses Rizin while protecting our free codebase.</p><h2 id=instructions-for-participants>Instructions for participants<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#instructions-for-participants>#</a></h2><p>Participants who want to apply to the Rizin project for the Google Summer of Code 2025 are required to submit a small pull request accomplishing one of the <a href=#microtasks>microtasks</a> (see below) as part of their application. You can also choose any of the GitHub issues for Rizin if they are big enough to be a qualification task and still small enough to be finished in no more than a couple of weeks. To help participants understand how to contribute to the project, there are issues marked as <strong>&ldquo;good first issue&rdquo;</strong> for both <a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin/labels/good%20first%20issue>Rizin</a> and <a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/cutter/labels/good%20first%20issue>Cutter</a>.</p><h2 id=programming-languages>Programming languages<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#programming-languages>#</a></h2><p>Most of Rizin is written in C (conforming to the C99 standard), and hence, we expect participants to be familiar with C programming language. For some of our tasks or microtasks, such as <a href=https://github.com/rizinorg/rz-pm>rz-pm</a>, they should know the Go programming language.

Currently, it is pulling most information from Rizin only on demand. This is problematic because sometimes the user performs changes (via plugins, the console widget, and more) that are affecting the information from Rizin, but Cutter doesn&rsquo;t know about these changes to apply the to the UI. For example, if a user will define a new function in a Python script or via the console widget by using the Rizin command <code>af @ &lt;addr></code>, Cutter will not show this new function in the Functions widget until the user will refresh the interface manually (Edit -> Refresh Contents).
The goal of this task is to use an event-driven architecture to overcome this limitation.</p><p>In addition, this task will also handle the analysis in the background feature, to allow the analysis performed by Rizin to happen while the interface is active.</p><h3 id=tasks>Tasks<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#tasks>#</a></h3><p>The overall implementation of this task should start from Rizin by adding events to many of the functions.

They provide a way to both manually and automatically manage and use information about classes in the binary.

Let&rsquo;s assume eax is the base pointer of a vtable we have saved in class analysis and we want to find out the actual address of the called method.</p><p>So there should be a command that takes the offset (in this case 0x6c) and looks up the actual destination.
It should be possible to call this command with a specific class, so it only looks into its vtable, or without a class, so it gives a list of possible destinations for all vtables that are not too small for the offset.</p><p>When that is implemented, one could also add a command that does the same thing, but automatically takes the offset from the opcode at the current seek.</p><h3 id=task-4>Task<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#task-4>#</a></h3><ul><li>Connecting classes with their methods</li><li>Class inheritance - nesting data structs</li><li>Constructors and destructors autorecognition</li><li><code>try</code>/<code>catch</code>/<code>finally</code> recognition and marking</li><li>arguments recognition</li><li>ASCII/graphviz graph of class inheritance/structure inheritance</li><li>Tests with sources for C++, FreePascal, D language, ObjC and Swift, for rizin-testbins</li><li>Classes list via <code>Vb</code>.
